CSS Foundations Exercise C
Let's build a little off the previous exercise, in which you added multiple classes to a single element in order to apply two different rules to it.

1.  You should see a black background and white text on the first button element.
2.  You should see a yellow background on the second button element.
3.  You should set a font size of 28px using a grouping selector.
4.  You should have a list of fonts containing Helvetica and Times New Roman with sans-serif as a fallback.
5.  You should see a unique class name on each element.
6.  You should have a grouping selector for styles that both elements share.
